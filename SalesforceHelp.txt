Salesforce is your customer success platform, designed to help you sell, service, market, analyze, and connect with your customers.

Salesforce is cloud computing platform.
Cloud Computing : is using remote servers to manage and process the rather than doing it on  local server/pc. Data/software application  is stored on remote servers and we are accessing it on our own machines using internet.Using sw application over internet.
it involves 2 entities

1. sw apps deliverd on the cloud(vendor)  Salesforec
2. sw apps accessible via cloud(client)  XYZ 
cloud-->internet
computing--<action,computing
 three models of cloud service
Software as a Service(SaaS): It refers to cloud-based software/application  that is hosted online by a company and is available for purchase on a subscription basis and is delivered via the internet.JIRA , DropBox

Platform as a Service (PaaS) : It refers to cloud-based platform services that provide developers with a framework they can use to build custom applications upon. Google App Engine,OpenShift

Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): It refers to cloud-based infrastructure resources that are delivered to organizations via virtualization technology that help organizations build and manage their servers, network, operating systems, and data storage.AWS,Azure

Salesforce is both SaaS and PaaS
IOT cloud, analytical platform ,Salesforce CRM


Deployment Models;
Public:amazon ,salesforce--anybody can access the services 
is one in which the services and infrastr are provided off-site over internet.

Private: azure ,vmware,open stack --companies will buy the sw and hw from vendor and install in their premises, it will be accessable to the employees of that comany.private cloud is one which the services and infratrs are maintained on private nw.


Hybrid:combination of public and private

Building Blocks of Salesforce
==============================
Tabs-are used to access the object
profiles-collection of settings and permissions that a user have 
Objects--are database tables where actual data is stored CRUD
Fields--attributes of Object data types text,date,number, etc
Records--are collection of fields and values that represents an entity/instance.

Data Management Techniques

https://trailhead.salesforce.com/en/content/learn/modules/data_modeling
1. Data Import for records <50000
2. Data loading for records >50000

Salesforce uses Relational DataBase

Security Model-- visibility specifies the scope of the filed 
Profiles/Permission
Field-Level Security for Profile

RelationShips:
Course Master table
Student Child
1 course can be enrolled by many stu but 1 stu can enroll only 1 course
No primary anf foreign key  
In Salesforce create relation from child side

3 types of relation ships
Lookup relationship--One to Many relationShip, lookup realtionship is created on child.even if we delete the master , no effect on child records.

	Course

Student		Assessment

		Accounts

	Opportunities		Contacts	

Master-Details RelationShip(Same as Primary -Foreign key) :-is the parent child relationship . we can not delete data from parent Object as there are dependent child object . when we delete data from master associated child entries also get deleted.no orphan records.



course(Parent)--Student(Child)


,

External lookup Relationship
In salesforce Many to many relation is not possible, but by adding junction object we can create M:M relationship.

Day 3:
=========================================================
Salesforce Security Model:
Users, Profiles,permission set, Roles.
Levels of Data Access
In this section, we will discuss the different levels of Data Access. There are four levels of data access.

Organization Level
It is created by maintaining a list of authorized users, setting password policies, and limiting login access to certain hours and certain locations.

Objects Level
It is done by setting permission on a particular object by allowing selective viewing, editing or deleting of any object in that record.

Fields Level
It is used to restrict access of users to certain fields even when the user has access to the object containing the field.

Records Level
This access level permits the user to access only certain records of an object.

In this chapter, we are going to focus on Control Access to the Organization using the three mechanisms described below.

profile--have set of permissions.Profile settings determine what users can see (control the visibility of objects, tabs, CRUD, fields) and do with objects.A profile controls “Object permissions, Field permissions, User permissions, Tab settings, App settings, Apex class access, Visualforce page access, Page layouts, Record Types, Login hours & Login IP ranges.

permission sets-to assign additional permission to an individual  . grant and revoke the permission sets, that extends the functionality of profile

Roles controle which records/objects a user can SEE based on their role in the hierarchy.A role hierarchy controls the level of visibility that users have to an organization data. By defining role hierarchies we can share access to records. Users assigned to roles near the top of hierarchies like (CEO, executives, and other higher level roles) get to access the data of all users who fall directly below them I hierarchy.


Forexample 
Sales team will work with leads,,opportunities  where as marketing team will focus on marketing of a product,existing customers, new customers leads ,opp,customers, customer support team no need of leads and oppro only cutsomers details are required for customer handling .

Sales team had can have additional permissions along with sales profile.
